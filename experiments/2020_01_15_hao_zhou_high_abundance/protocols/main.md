## Procedure
### Probe Extension
1. Prep PCR tubes
    1. Add 1ul extension hairpin to PCR tube.
1. Make extension mix
    1. Make dHTP/dDTP mix.
    2. Make extension mix on ice excluding polymerase.
    3. Add Cleaning hairpin.
    4. Add polymerase.
1. Transfer extension mix to PCR tube with hairpin and mix (Final volume 98μl).
    1. Incubate 15min at 37˚C.
3. Add Probe Oligos and mix.
    1. Incubate 60min § at 37˚C.
    2. Deactivate 20min at 80˚C.
    3. Cool to 4˚C.
4. Gel assessment
    1. Dilute 1ul sample 1:4 in H2O.
    2. Load 20ul of the resulting mix to a gel.
    3. Dilute 1ul of original probe solution 1:100,000 in H20 and load 20ul.
    4. Also load 20ul of a 50bp ladder diluted 1:20.
    5. Run Gel on invitrogen module until short sequence band separation on the ladder is  clear.
    6. Image the gel. Bands should appear at the same length as the original probe and/or at a few bp longer (hairpin), and at 100-500 bp longer (extended probe). The extended probe is often weak and streaky
### Deparaffinization and autofluorescence quenching
1. Place slide in 60˚C oven for 1hr.
2. Wash slide in the following sequence
    1. Xylene 15min x2
    3. 100% EtOH 5min
1. Measure 0.5g Sodium borohydride and add to ~25ml PBS 1x at 4˚C on ice in the fume hood. Top PBS to 50ml and leave cap off or loose in hood.
2. Wash sample in PBS and add to chilled 1% Sodium borohydride solution for 30min.
3. Wash slide with Isopropanol 99% and transfer to PBS 1x at RT to wash. Add Isopropanol to sodium borohydride in waste container. Leave waste cap loose until off-gassing is complete (~1day).

### Permeabilization
1. incubate cells/tissue with lysozyme for 1hr at 37˚C
2. Wash in PBS
3. Wash in 100% EtOH.

### rRNA FISH and mRNA FISH
1. Incubate slides with encoding probes in hybridization buffer
    1. 12hrs at 46˚C.
    2. Wash in wash buffer for 15min at 48˚C.
    3. Rinse in EtOH and allow to dry.
1. Incubate slides with branching probes in hybridization buffer
    1. 1hr at 46˚C.
    2. Wash in wash buffer for 15min at 48˚C.
    3. Rinse in EtOH and allow to dry.
1. Incubate slides with adapter and readout probes in hybridization buffer
    1. 30min at RT.
    2. Wash in wash buffer for 15min at 48˚C.
    3. Rinse in EtOH and allow to dry.
3. Pipette $15 \mu l$ resin onto sample and apply coverglass
