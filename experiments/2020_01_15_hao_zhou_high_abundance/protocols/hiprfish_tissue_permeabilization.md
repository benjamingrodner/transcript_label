# tissue bacterial permeabilization
Given fixed tissue, this is a protocol to permeabilize bacterial cell walls for hiprfish.

## materials
- tissue slice formalin fixed on a slide
- lysozyme 100mg/ml in Tris-HCL 10mM pH7.5
- biorad frameseal chambers
- PBS 1x
- EtOH 50%

## protocol
1. incubate cells/tissue with lysozyme for 1hr at 37ËšC
2. Wash in PBS
3. Store in 50% EtOH
