## materials
- Sodium borohydride
  - Danger: produces hydrogen gas when encouters water. If ignites, do not put out with water, use powder. Toxic as well. 
- PBS 1x at 4˚C
- PBS 1x at RT
- Isopropanol 99%

## procedure
1. Measure 0.5g Sodium borohydride and add to ~25ml PBS 1x at 4˚C on ice in the fume hood. Top PBS to 50ml and leave cap off or loose in hood.
2. Wash sample in PBS and add to chilled 1% Sodium borohydride solution for 30min.
3. Wash slide with Isopropanol 99% and transfer to PBS 1x at RT to wash. Add Isopropanol to sodium borohydride in waste container. Leave waste cap loose.
