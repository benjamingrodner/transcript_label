# Stain Bacterial cells with HiPR-FISH

## Materials
- Hybridization buffer
  - 20x SSC 10ul
  - Denhardt's sol 10ul
  - Dextran sulfate 20ul
  - Ethylene carbonate 20ul
  - 1% SDS 1ul
  - 20 U/ul SUPERase 1ul
  - probe Xul
  - RNAse free ultrapure water 38-Xul
- Wash buffer
  - 5M NaCl 2.15ml
  - 1M HCl 1ml
  - 0.5M EDTA 0.5ml
  - Fill to 50ml with DEPC  water

## Procedure
1. Encoding and Readout hybridization
    1. Prep Wash buffers and heat to 48˚C.
    1. Pipette 1ul cells onto a slide and allow liquid to evaporate. Incubate with 18ul hybridization buffer with encoding probes for 4hr at 46˚C. Wash in wash buffer for 15min at 48˚C. Rinse in EtOH.
    2. If using branch probes, incubate slides with hybridization buffer with branch probes for 1hr at 46˚C
    2. Incubate hybridization buffer with readout probes for 30min at RT. Wash in wash buffer for 15min at 48˚C. Rinse in EtOH.
    3. Pipette 15ul resin onto slide and cover with coverslip.
2. Imaging
    1. Image on confocal microscope with spectral readout.
