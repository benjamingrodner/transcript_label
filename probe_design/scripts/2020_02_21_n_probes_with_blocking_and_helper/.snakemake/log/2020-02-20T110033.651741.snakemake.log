Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 255 of /local/workdir/bmg224/hiprfish/mobile_elements/probe_design/scripts/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/workdir/bmg224/hiprfish/mobile_elements/probe_design/runs/2020_02_13_gfp_plasmid/{sample}/primer3/{feature}.int
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
