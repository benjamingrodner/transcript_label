# transcript_label
This project is focused on labeling bacterial transcripts with in-situ hybridization probes. 
We would like to combine transcript labeling with rRNA taxonomic labeling via HiPR-FISH.
Transcript labeling is made possible by probe signal amplification via SABER.

Meeting with Hao Zhou in Professor Ilana Brito's lab, we discussed using bulk RNA sequencing data to inform transcript targeting in mouse gut. 
We have mouse gut tissue blocks FFPE from the same samples but at a later timepoint from the RNA seq data.
The RNA seq data is focused on identifying bacterial transcriptional responses to antibiotic treatment. 
Hao Zhou also has a computational pipeline to associate transcripts with specific clade.
